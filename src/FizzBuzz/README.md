FizzBuzz
--------

##### Can you say Fizz and Buzz?

Open [FizzBuzz.php](FizzBuzz.php) and start hacking away.

The rules are

* If the number `$testNumber` can be divived with `$fizz` then say *Fizz*
* If `$testNumber` can be divived with `$buzz` then say *Buzz*
* If `$testNumber` can be divided with both, then say *FizzBuzz*
* Otherwise just say the `$testNumber`

How much code do you need to write?

Can you make it even less code?
